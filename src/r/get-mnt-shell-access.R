#more R-over-shell

#how can I get the volume of files reported to me? In.... this dataframe?
#https://fs.r-lib.org/

install.packages("fs")
library("fs")
?fs
dir_ls()
#But, I have to get into the volumes, as in mnt/shell/, to do that work
#Can I do that through, this terminal?
#Yes, but there's errors throwing about the mont point not existing.
